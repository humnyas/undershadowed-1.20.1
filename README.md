### About

**Undershadowed** is a Minecraft mod that overhauls the vanilla entity shadow system. With a focus on a *vanilla+* aesthetic, it introduces dynamic, pixel-precise shadows that update **every tick**.

Despite its advanced rendering, Undershadowed is lightweight and **adds no noticeable lag**. It's designed to work seamlessly with most mods and enhance the visual depth of your world.
